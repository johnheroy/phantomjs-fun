# PhantomJS Fun

This is a collection of web-scraping utility scripts built in PhantomJS / CasperJS to quickly access data from the command line.

To alias the script to a convenient terminal command you can add a similar line to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile file:

`alias whatthetemp='casperjs /Users/johnheroy/Development/phantomjs-fun/whatthetemp.js'`
